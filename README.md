# Pricing Analytics
### Hi everyone. My name is Yiqun. This repository contains two pricing analytics projects that were completed by me and other two team members, Zhaosong Yuan and Jiacheng Tan. At project 1, we aimed to build a log-log regression model to find the best variables combination to explain the vehicle demand. At project 2, we gave our pricing strategy under two scenarios, with customer segmentation and without customer segmentation. These two projects are course-based projects and all the datasets were provided by our professor.
